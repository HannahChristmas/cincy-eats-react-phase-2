# Phase 2 Final Project- Cincy Eats Restaurant Passport

## Overview

This application allows users to view, add, and check off restaurants in Cincinnati. Users can filter through existing restaurants or add a restaurant of their own. Restaurants can also be marked as "visited" or "still on the list."

## Installation Instructions
* Fork and clone on github
* Run npm install
* Run npm run server. This will run your backend on port 3004.
* Run npm start

## Usage
* Navigation bar that allows user to toggle among Home, Our Spots, and Add A Spot
* Search restaurants by name
* Filter restaurants by neighborhood, cuisine, whether the restaurant has been visited, or all of the above
* Click the visited button to display whether the restaurant has been visited- change persists on the backend
* Add new restaurant to the DOM and to the backend at Add A Spot.

<!-- ### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it. -->
